Functions for computing the forward (type 2) NUFFT Fourier transform: from grid 
data to nonuniformly sampled output. Since the forward calculation is used to 
estimate diffraction images by slicing through the autocorrelation the functions 
are hardcoded to compute the Fourier transform rather than its inverse (isign=-1).
